Backbone + Spotify = Backify... or Spotibone !
==============================================

PLEASE NOTE - Tracks only seems to play on GOOGLE CHROME.

***

The goal of this test is to create a semi-­‐functional web-­‐based Music Player interface using HTML5 and JavaScript.

Your interface will need to serve three purposes:

	1. Perform track/artist/album searches . We recommend using the Spotify Metadata API to facilitate these searches: (http://developer.spotify.com/en/)

	2. Maintain playlists 
		a. CRUD (Create, Remove, Update, Delete) 
		b. Add/remove tracks 
	Maintain a current queue of songs 

	3. Player controls 
		a. Play -­‐ Hint: “Play” songs using setTimeout for the song length 
		b. Stop 
		c. Rewind 
		d. Fast forward
